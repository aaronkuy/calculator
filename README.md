# Calculator

## Description
A sleek and functional calculator application designed with a professional "Glassmorphism" aesthetic. The app provides a reliable interface for basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features real-time display updates and robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Features
- **Professional UI:** Styled with a dark-theme glassmorphism design, featuring smooth transitions and tactile button feedback.
- **Arithmetic Logic:** Full support for basic math operations with a clean, easy-to-read neon display.
- **Error Handling:** Implementation of `try-catch` blocks to handle invalid mathematical expressions (e.g., preventing crashes on syntax errors).
- **Responsive Grid:** A perfectly aligned button layout using CSS Grid for consistent spacing and sizing.
- **Instant Reset:** A dedicated clear function to quickly reset the calculation state.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (Structural layout and input handling)
- **JavaScript** (Calculation logic and DOM manipulation)
- **CSS3** (CSS Grid, Flexbox, and advanced Hover effects)
- **V8 Engine Logic** (Utilizing `eval()` for mathematical expression parsing)

## The things I've learned
- **Logic Implementation:** I learned how to use the `eval()` function safely within a `try-catch` block to process string-based mathematical expressions.
- **Advanced CSS Layouts:** I solidified my understanding of **CSS Grid** to create a non-linear button layout and used **pseudo-classes** like `:active` to simulate a physical button press.
- **DOM Interaction:** I improved my skills in manipulating the `value` property of input elements directly via JavaScript functions.
- **UX Design:** I learned how to prioritize button hierarchy using different colors for operators vs. numbers to improve user navigation.
